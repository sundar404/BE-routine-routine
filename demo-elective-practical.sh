echo "=================================================="

echo "ðŸ“‹ Summary of Changes:"
echo "â€¢ Elective practical classes no longer require lab group selection"
echo "â€¢ They are implemented the same as lecture classes but labeled as 'Practical'"
echo "â€¢ Regular (non-elective) practical classes still work with lab groups"
echo "â€¢ Backend now properly handles classType for elective classes"

echo ""
echo "ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation:"
echo "â€¢ Frontend: Modified AssignClassModal.jsx validation and UI logic"
echo "â€¢ Backend: Fixed routineSlotController.js to use provided classType instead of hardcoded 'L'"
echo "â€¢ Display: RoutineGrid.jsx already handles 'P' classType correctly as 'Practical'"

echo ""
echo "ðŸŽ¯ Test Cases to Verify:"
echo "1. Create elective practical class (7th/8th semester) â†’ Should work without lab groups"
echo "2. Create elective lecture class â†’ Should work as before"
echo "3. Create regular practical class â†’ Should still require lab groups"
echo "4. View routine â†’ Elective practical should show as 'Practical', not 'Lecture'"

echo ""
echo "âœ… Ready for Testing!"
echo "Navigate to: Admin â†’ Routine Management â†’ Assign Class"
echo "Try creating a 7th semester elective with classType = 'Practical'"
