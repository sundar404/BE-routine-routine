# Test Plan: Elective Practical Classes

## Summary of Changes Made

### Frontend Changes (AssignClassModal.jsx)
1. **Validation Update**: Made lab group type optional for elective practical classes
   - Line 664: Changed validation to not require lab group type for elective practical classes
   - `if (values.classType === 'P' && !isElectiveClass && !values.labGroupType)`

2. **UI Updates**: Hide lab group selection for elective practical classes
   - Line 1216: Added `!isElectiveClass` condition to hide lab group selection UI
   - Line 1274: Added `!isElectiveClass` condition to hide "both groups" interface

3. **Form Logic**: Updated class type change handler
   - Line 746: Modified to clear lab group type for elective practical classes
   - `if (changedValues.classType !== 'P' || isElectiveClass)`

4. **Processing Logic**: Separate handling for elective vs non-elective practical classes
   - Line 944: Added condition to only handle traditional lab classes
   - `if (currentClassType === 'P' && !isElectiveClass)`

5. **Subject Selection**: Updated to show normal subject selection for elective practical classes
   - Line 1478: Modified condition to show subject selection for elective practical classes

### Backend Changes (routineSlotController.js)
1. **Class Type Support**: Added proper class type handling for elective classes
   - Line 336: Added `classType = 'L'` to destructuring with default value
   - Line 423: Changed from hardcoded `'L'` to use provided `classType`

## Test Cases to Verify

### Test Case 1: Create Elective Practical Class (7th Semester)
- **Action**: Create a new elective practical class for 7th semester
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - No lab group selection required
  - Class should be created with classType = 'P'
  - Should appear as "Practical" in routine
  - Should work the same as lecture but labeled differently

### Test Case 2: Create Elective Lecture Class (Baseline)
- **Action**: Create a new elective lecture class for 7th semester
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Should work as before
  - Class should be created with classType = 'L'
  - Should appear as "Lecture" in routine

### Test Case 3: Create Regular Practical Class (Non-Elective)
- **Action**: Create a regular practical class for any semester
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Should still require lab group selection
  - Should work as before (no regression)

### Test Case 4: Routine Display Verification
- **Action**: View routine after creating elective practical class
- **Expected Behavior**:
  - Class should be labeled as "Practical" not "Lecture"
  - Should appear in both AB and CD section routines
  - Should have elective styling/indicators

## Verification Steps

1. Start the application
2. Navigate to Admin → Routine Management
3. Try creating elective practical classes for 7th/8th semester
4. Verify no lab group selection is shown
5. Check that the class is created successfully
6. View the routine to confirm proper labeling

## Expected Results

✅ Elective practical classes can be created without lab group selection
✅ They appear as "Practical" in the routine display
✅ They work exactly like lecture classes but with different labeling
✅ Regular (non-elective) practical classes still work as before
✅ No breaking changes to existing functionality
